# Getting Here

The event is being held in the **Alumni Auditorium** in the Forum Building. The building is on the Streatham Campus of the University of Exeter, marked on this map. 
If you're coming by car, there is plenty of parking available on campus. We advise using car parks A, B, and, D, which are well signposted when on campus. There is also a park-and-ride scheme operating on the outskirts of the city. 

You can also get to the campus by bus using the UNI bus service, which operates from the city centre.
