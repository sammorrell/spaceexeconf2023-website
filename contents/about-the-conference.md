# About the Conference

One thing we are passionate about as a society is sharing the wonders of the universe with everyone. 
This effort took a little bit of a back seat in 2020, but we are back with with our fourth conference in March 2023.

This year we are bringing space down to Earth with a fantastic line-up of speakers bridging the gap between the astronomical and the terrestrial. We have booked the Alumini Auditorium in the Forum for what proves to be an inspiring day of talks.

Everyone is welcome to come along for a single talk or for the whole day.
