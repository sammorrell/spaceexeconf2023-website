# About the Conference

One thing we are passionate about as a society is sharing the wonders of the universe with everyone. 
This is one of the reasons we are delighted to be organising our third conference devoted to all things space.

Once again, we have some fantastic speakers coming from the University of Exeter, Met Office, Heidelberg Univeristy, Norman Lockyer Observatory and others. This year we have an open area in the Peter Chalk Centre, where our exhibitors from the Institute of Physics, First Light Optics and others are coming along to show you some of the wonderful astronomy and space science related things going on in the South West. 

Stay tuned to our lastest updates on speakers and programme. Here is an example of our event last year.

Everyone is welcome to come along for a single talk or for the whole day. 
We look forward to seeing you.
