By day, Dr Des Howlett is a professional Engineer who runs training courses in electronic design and computer programming. Outside work, he is a Director of the Norman Lockyer Observatory and enjoys spending hours just looking at the patterns in the stars and planets. He was interested in spaceflight from a very young age, with his heart set on walking on the Moon, but was unfortunately too late to join the Apollo programme, and too old to be part of Artemis. For him, looking at the heavens is the next best thing.
