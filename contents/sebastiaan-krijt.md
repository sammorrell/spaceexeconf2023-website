Sebastiaan is a lecturer in the University of Exeter’s astrophysics group where his research focuses on planet formation and protoplanetary disc evolution. Before moving to Exeter, he was a NASA Hubble Fellow at the University of Arizona’s Steward Observatory and a postdoctoral scholar at the University of Chicago’s Department of the Geophysical Sciences.

Exoplanet occurrence rates indicate that a large fraction of Sun-like stars host Earth-sized planets in their habitable zones, implying the existence of billions of potentially habitable worlds in our Milky Way alone. But how Earth-like are these Earth-sized planets really? And what does that even mean? In his talk he will describe how we can use our increasingly complete understanding of planet formation to help characterise temperate, rocky exoplanets.
