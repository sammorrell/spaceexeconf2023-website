Alex is a third year Physics with Astrophysics student at the University of Exeter. His masters project is building a real time weather forecasting system for future crewed exploration of Mars. Outside of his degree he is the current president of Space Exe and as part of this role he leads our star gazing activities and the oversee the rest of our activities.

As fans of the Martian may realise Martian dust storms can be dangerous. These storms may begin as localised storms but can grow into planet engulfing storms, so landing a crewed mission can be difficult. During his talk he will explain the major factors which make up the Martian climate and how we can adapt the current Met Office Unified Model which is used for weather and climate predictions on Earth to modern day Mars.
