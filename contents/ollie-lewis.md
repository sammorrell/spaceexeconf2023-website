My name is Ollie and I am a PhD student in my second year working with the University and the Met Office on a new weather observation method.  I've been fascinated by all things weather-related since I was a young lad and working with the Met Office has always been a dream of mine.  I am currently exploring how we can use the refraction of aircraft radio signals to measure humidity.  The air, much like water, refracts and bends light, and the amount of bending can tell us a huge amount about the temperature, pressure, and humidity of the atmosphere.  My work aims to use this new source of observation data to potentially improve weather forecasts in the UK and beyond!
