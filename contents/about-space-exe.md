# About Space Exe

Space Exe is a society at the University of Exeter for all the students who look up at the sky with wonder. Created seven years ago, we believe that space is for everyone, whether you want to study its intricacies or enjoy its beauty. We have worked to build a radio telescope for students and the general public to use, as well as hosted stargazing events on campus where the vastness of the night sky can be appreciated.

We are also building a high altitude balloon, which we plan to launch soon, which will measure the carbon dioxide profile of the atmosphere as it ascends, as well as take beautiful photos of the curvature of the Earth. 

We want to spread the love of space to as many people as possible; fostering a community at the University of Exeter for everyone who shares that love with us.
