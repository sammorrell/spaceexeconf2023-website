p 
	| To cover the costs of hosting the conference, we are selling tickets for admission to the talks. 
	| However, admission to the Peter Chalk centre, where the exhibitors will be, is <b>free</b> and does not require a ticket. 
	| Any profit that we make will be put straight back into the projects run by Space:Exe for our members and towards funding future conferences and events. 
	| They can be purchased by both students and the general public from the Students' Guild website ahead of the conference, or on the door.
